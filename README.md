> **Abstract**  
Neural Operators are fast and accurate surrogates for nonlinear mappings between functional spaces within training domains. Extrapolation beyond the training domain remains a grand challenge across all application areas. We present Time-Conditioned UNet (TC-UNet) as an operator learning method to solve time-dependent PDEs continuously in time without any temporal discretization, including in extrapolation scenarios. TC-UNet incorporates the temporal evolution of the PDE into its architecture by combining a parameter conditioning approach with the attention mechanism from the Transformer architecture. After training, TC-UNet makes real-time inferences on an arbitrary temporal grid. We demonstrate its extrapolation capability on a climate problem by estimating the global temperature for several years and also for inviscid hypersonic flow around a double cone. We propose different training strategies involving temporal bundling and sub-sampling. We demonstrate performance improvements for several benchmarks, performing extrapolation for long time intervals and zero-shot super-resolution time.

### Installation

To install all dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Code Structure

The main code lives in the `src/` folder.

- The entry point is: `src/ditto/main_local.py`  
- Configurations for experiments are in: `src/configs/`

You can control experiments by:
1. Editing the config files to set parameters.
2. Choosing the relevant `run()` function inside `main_local.py`.

---

### Quick Start

A ready-to-run example is already set up using the **TC-UNet-s** model (`ditto_subsampled_X10`) on the **Navier-Stokes** equation with **N = 1000** initial conditions.

Youâ€™ll find everything pre-configured in:
- `src/ditto/main_local.py`
- `src/configs/navier_stokes.py`

Just run:

```bash
python src/ditto/main_local.py
```

After training, results and the saved model will appear in a new folder called `outputs/`.
